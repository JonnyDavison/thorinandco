<p>
    The formation of the group grew out of a meeting Gandalf had with Thorin in Bree which kindled Thorin's interest in
    recapturing his long lost family inheritance. (Thorin's grandfather had been the King under the Mountain when Smaug
    came and took it.) Remembering that he had once known an adventurous Hobbit on his travels in the Shire, Gandalf
    decided to add Bilbo to their company because he knew that stealth and cunning were preferable to force. Gandalf
    also believed that someone like Bilbo could keep the sometimes prideful and stubborn Dwarves from rash action. The
    superstitious Dwarves also considered thirteen to be an unlucky number, and as Gandalf had planned to leave on other
    business, welcomed a fourteenth to fill into their party.

        <h3>Thorin Oakensheild</h3>
        <p>
            Thorin II was born in TA 2746 to Dwarf prince Thráin II in the city of the Lonely Mountain. Early in his
            youth, he and
            the other Dwarves of the Lonely Mountain were forced to flee by the dragon Smaug in TA 2770. While in exile,
            he quickly
            grew to become a capable warrior. This was demonstrated when he participated in the Battle of Azanulbizar in
            TA 2799. He
            fought with one of the Dwarven armies beneath the East-gate of Moria. At some point in the fighting, his
            shield broke,
            and using an oaken tree branch found on the ground as a shield, he gained the epithet "Oakenshield," which
            would remain
            with him even in death.

        <h3>Fíli and Kíli</h3>
        <p>
            Fíli and Kíli were nephews of Thorin, who was the elder brother of their mother, Dís. They were also nephews
            of Frerin,
            grandsons of Thráin II, and great-grandsons of Thrór. Fíli's most distinguishing feature was his long nose,
            the longest
            of any of the Dwarves in Thorin's company.[2]

            As the youngest Dwarves, Fíli and Kíli had the sharpest eyes, and were often sent scouting or searching. It
            was they
            that found the Front Porch while in the Misty Mountains.

        <h3>Óin</h3>
        <p>
            Óin was the older brother of Glóin, cousin of Dwalin and Balin, and uncle of Gimli. Óin's uncle was Fundin,
            the father
            of Balin and Dwalin.

            Óin fought in the Battle of Azanulbizar along with Thorin Oakenshield, and in TA 2941 joined Thorin's
            company on the
            quest to reclaim the Lonely Mountain, wearing a brown hood.[2] Óin was one of the Dwarves who bet that Bilbo
            would come
            along with them to reclaim the Lonely Mountain. Óin and his brother Glóin were usually in charge of
            preparing the fire
            for the Company, as they were the most skilled of the group. He fought in and survived the Battle of Five
            Armies, and
            later settled in the Lonely Mountain with King Dáin II Ironfoot, along with many other Dwarves of the
            company of Thorin

            <h3>Glóin</h3>
            <p>
                Glóin, son of Gróin was one of the Dwarves of Thorin II Oakenshield's company who set out to reclaim the
                Lonely Mountain
                in the Quest of Erebor. He was also the father of Gimli, who became a member of the Fellowship of the
                Ring.

                Glóin chiefly appears in The Hobbit as a supporting character. Glóin also appears in The Fellowship of
                the Ring during
                the Council of Elrond.

            <h3>Balin</h3>
            <p>
                Balin was a Dwarf leader, the son of Fundin, and elder brother of Dwalin. He was one of the thirteen
                Dwarves who
                accompanied Thorin II Oakenshield on the quest to regain the Lonely Mountain.
                A Dwarf Lord known for his wise counsel and willingness to listen, he was one of Thorin's closest
                friends and advisers.
                Balin was distantly related to him, and a descendant of the noble House of Durin.

                He later went to re-establish the Dwarf presence in Moria, but within five years it was overcome once
                more by Orcs, and
                he was killed there along with the rest of his companions.

                    regain the Lonely Mountain from the Dragon Smaug. He was the brother of Balin and the youngest son
